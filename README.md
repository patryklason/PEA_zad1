# Brute Force and Dynamic Programming 
CLI program implementing Brute Force and Dynamic Programming algorithms for solving Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem.

The program reads graph from a text file, performs selected algorithm and displays minimal cost and path.

## Structure of text file
>**1. line**: number of vertices
>
>**next lines**: cost matrix (values in row separated by space)
>
>Diagonal values should be -1 or 0

Example text file:
```
3
0 3 1
5 0 5
3 6 0
```
